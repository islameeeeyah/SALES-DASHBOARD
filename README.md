# SALES-DASHBOARD
I created a visualization that clearly depicts the sales pattern of a company, comparing the months, sales type, mode of payment in a visually appealing, story-telling and easy way for the audience to read and understand. I have made a lot of progress compared to my previous repo. Kindly  give me your feedbacks

Here is a preview of the file I uploaded names "interactive dashboard.xlsx"
